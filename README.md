# MATLAB toolbox for the control volume finite element method (CVFEM)
MATCVFEM is a free set of MATLAB functions for the numericalsolution of moving boundary problem using the control volume finite element method.
## Download and Installation
In order to install and use the MATCVFEM, you must already have a [MATFEM](https://github.com/parkmh/MATFEM) toolbox on your computer.

* Download the MATCVFEM to your desktop
```
git clone https://github.com/parkmh/MATCVFEM.git
```

* Open MATLAB and type the following in the command window:
```
>> cd (MATCVFEM folder)
>> install
```

## Mesh Generation
*pdetool* starts the PDE app, which helps you to draw the 2-D domain and refine mesh.

* Run *pdetool*.
```
>> pdetool
```

* Create a 2D domain.
